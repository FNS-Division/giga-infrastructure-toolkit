# Giga School Connectivity Options Toolkit

Package with set of modules to perform infrastructure mapping and analysis to assess connectivity options for schools.

It's a processing toolkit that takes points of interests (PoIs) as an input and overlays them with mobile coverage areas to identify whethet PoIs covered with the signal, calculates distances to the closest cellular towers and fiber nodes, identifies visibility between cell towers and the PoIs, calculates fiber paths taking into account mutual PoIs locations, and determines population number living around the PoIs based on population density maps. Finally, it produces interactive maps containing  PoI layers with infrastructure attributes (distances, coverages, etc.).
